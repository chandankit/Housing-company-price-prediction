# Housing-company-price-prediction
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. 
The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. 
Build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
